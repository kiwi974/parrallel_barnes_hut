This folder contains : 

	- the code mainMPI modified to run the tests : "MPI_Barrier" at the 
	  end of the while loop has been removed AND this code writes in a 
	  text file at every iteration (I/O)
	
	- slides for the presentation 
	

Remark : in the slides, the linear regression curves for the strong 
scaling are bad. I have no idea why, I tried with to different Python 
libraries but non gave satisfying results.
